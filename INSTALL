This program requires that you have Racket (http://racket-lang.org)
and Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) installed. It also assumes a
standard, POSIX-compliant environment.

To install, put the relation-map/ directory somewhere useful, and edit
the file config.rc so that the RELATION_MAP_HOME variable is set
to the location of relation-map/. Then, edit RELATION_MAP_BIN to be
the directory where the script should be installed. Finally, you can
run install.sh to copy these files to their proper locations.

You should then be able to run relation-map.
